# CLOCR-C: Context Leveraging OCR Correction using Language Models

CLOCR-C (Clock-Er-Sea), is a post-OCR correction approach using Language Models. The repo-represents the academic work used to demonstrate the concept.


# Key notebooks

This work is arranged by notebooks. The key note books are numbered as follows

1. Prompt testing: Testing the range of sub-prompt combinations on the three datasets across all models using the dev set.
2. LLM comparison: Using the best performing prompt run tests across the test set.
3. Downstream task: Measure how the corrected texts have improved NER.
4. SocioCultural Context: Explore the importance of the socio-cultural context of the prompt and the Task Induced In Context Learning.
